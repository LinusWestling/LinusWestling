# 👋 Hi, I’m Linus Westling

I’m a **software developer in training** with a strong focus on **backend systems, scalable architectures, and real-world product development**.

My background in **HR, recruitment, and business analysis** gives me a strong edge: I understand users, requirements, and trade-offs — and I build software that solves *actual* problems, not just technical ones.

Right now, I’m building **production-ready applications** using **Java, Next.js 16, Supabase, React Native, and advanced SQL**, with a growing emphasis on backend architecture and system design.

## 🔎 What I’m Focused On
- Backend architecture & data modeling  
- Clean API design and authorization patterns  
- Scalable, maintainable full-stack systems  
- Bridging business requirements with technical solutions
